# RSS Feed Setup and Parser Server

This project sets up an RSS feed using provided documents and runs an RSS feed parser server.

## Project Overview

The project consists of setting up an RSS feed using provided files and running an RSS feed parser server built with Node.js and Express. The RSS server fetches and parses RSS feeds, serving the parsed data via an API. CORS is configured to allow cross-origin requests.
