# RSS-FEED
RSS Feed Server This repository contains a simple RSS feed server built using Node.js and Express. The server fetches and parses RSS feeds using the rss-parser package and provides a RESTful API endpoint to serve the parsed feed items. The frontend is developed using React to display the fetched RSS feed items dynamically.
